From Zero to Calculator Hero: How I Built a Sleek, Interactive Calculator with Just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!"

Ever wanted to build something both practical and fun? I took on the challenge of creating a fully functional calculator from scratchâ€”no fancy frameworks, just pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

ðŸ”¢ What It Does:

Basic Math Operations: Add, subtract, multiply, and divide with ease.

Interactive Design: Buttons that respond to clicks (and even keyboard input!).

Clean UI: A sleek, modern interface with a satisfying display animation.

Error Handling: No more "NaN" nightmaresâ€”graceful error messages instead!

ðŸ’¡ The Journey:

HTML: Structured the layout with a display and responsive buttons.

CSS: Styled it with gradients, shadows, and hover effects for a polished look.

JavaScript: Made it actually work with logic for calculations, clearing, and even decimal inputs.

ðŸš€ Why Itâ€™s Cool:
This wasnâ€™t just about crunching numbersâ€”it was about problem-solving, debugging (so much debugging!), and turning code into a real, clickable tool. And now? Itâ€™s alive!
